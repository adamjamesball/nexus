# Vision

We are building Nexus: a multi-agent platform that accelerates and improves the quality of sustainability work across domains including carbon accounting, product carbon footprinting (PCF), nature/biodiversity, social/ESG, and decarbonisation planning. Nexus acts as a collaborative AI partner that augments practitioners, improves data quality, and shortens time-to-insight.

## Why now
- Increasing regulatory pressure (e.g., CSRD, SEC, ISSB) and stakeholder expectations
- Fragmented data scattered across systems and formats
- Shortage of specialized sustainability expertise
- Maturation of multi-agent LLM ecosystems (reasoning, tools, memory, retrieval, planning)

## Long-term north star
- A self-improving, self-evolving, and self-healing application where agents continuously learn from outcomes, user feedback, and broader organizational context to deliver reliable, auditable sustainability outcomes.

## Scope of sustainability topics (seed list)
- Carbon accounting (corporate GHG Protocol scopes 1-3)
- Product Carbon Footprinting (PCF)
- Nature and biodiversity (TNFD-aligned assessment, drivers/pressures, dependencies/impacts)
- Social/ESG (human rights, DEI, supply chain labor, community impact)
- Energy and decarbonisation (abatement levers, scenario modeling, transition plans)
- Circularity and waste (material flows, recycling, reuse, end-of-life)
- Water stewardship (consumption, scarcity risk, discharge quality)
- Supply chain and procurement (supplier engagement, data collection, primary data upgrades)
- Regulatory reporting and assurance (CSRD, ESRS, SEC, ISSB, PCAF, SBTi)
- Risk and controls (audit trails, segregation of duties, approvals)

## What "self-improving" means for Nexus
- Learning from execution: outcomes, errors, success metrics feed into policy updates
- Learning from user interactions: thumbs-up/down, edits, comments refine prompts + policies
- Learning from data: ingestion pipelines and embeddings enrich organizational memory
- Continuous alignment to governance: changes are versioned, reviewed, and can roll back

## User value
- Faster time-to-first-draft for complex sustainability tasks
- Higher data completeness and consistency with expert recommendations
- Traceable, auditable outputs fit for assurance
- Orchestrated agents that move work forward end-to-end

## Guardrails
- Architecture deviations require explicit approval by the application owner
- Gold-standard defaults: secure by design, privacy-first, explainable, and auditable
