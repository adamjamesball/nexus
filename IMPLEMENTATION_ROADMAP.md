- [ ] **Backend & Multi-Model Gateway**: Initialize the FastAPI backend with a multi-model gateway for **Claude 4 Opus, Gemini 2.5 Pro, OpenAI's o3/gpt-oss series, Qwen3, and DeepSeek R1**.
- [ ] **Frontend Foundation**: Set up the Next.js frontend with a sleek, modern UI (Shadcn/ui) and a robust, chunked file upload system.
- [ ] **Continuous Learning Engine v1**: Build the foundational data pipeline for capturing all user feedback and agent interactions. This is a day-one, non-negotiable priority.

#### **Month 2: The Agentic Workflow**
- [ ] **Smart Document Agent**: Develop the multi-modal document processing agent, capable of handling a wide variety of formats.
- [ ] **Entity Intelligence Agent**: Build the core entity extraction and reasoning agent, leveraging our multi-model gateway.
- [ ] **AI Workflow Orchestrator v1**: Implement the initial version of our custom agent orchestration engine using **LangGraph**.
- [ ] **Knowledge Graph v1**: Design and implement the initial schema for our dynamic knowledge graph in Neo4j.
- [ ] **End-to-End Workflow**: Integrate the agents into a seamless, end-to-end workflow for organizational boundary analysis.

#### **Month 3: The User Experience & Launch**
- [ ] **Real-Time Agent Visualization**: Build the front-end components for visualizing agent collaboration in real time.
- [ ] **Interactive Feedback System**: Implement the user interface for collecting, managing, and learning from user feedback.
- [ ] **Reporting Agent v1**: Develop the initial version of the report generation agent.
- [ ] **Testing & Polish**: Conduct extensive end-to-end testing, performance optimization, and a full security audit.
- [ ] **Beta Launch**: Deploy the system to our first set of high-value beta users.

### **Phase 1 Success Metrics**:
- **Reliability**: >98% success rate on all organizational structure files.
- **Speed**: <2 minutes for complex, multi-document analysis.
- **User Experience**: <3 minutes from upload to actionable insight.
- **Intelligence**: The system can successfully process at least 15 different, previously unseen document formats.

- [ ] **Automated Model Fine-Tuning**: Implement the automated pipeline for fine-tuning our open-source models on specific tasks.
- [ ] **Knowledge Graph Expansion**: Begin to expand the knowledge graph with data from new domains (Carbon, Nature).
- [ ] **Carbon Expert Agent v1**: Develop the initial version of the Carbon Expert Agent.

#### **Month 5: Expanding the Agent Network**
- [ ] **Nature Expert Agent v1**: Develop the initial version of the Nature Expert Agent.
- [ ] **Social Impact Agent v1**: Develop the initial version of the Social Impact Agent.
- [ ] **AI Workflow Orchestrator v2**: Enhance the orchestrator to handle complex, multi-domain workflows.
- [ ] **Cross-Domain Insights**: Begin to generate insights that span multiple sustainability domains.

#### **Month 6: The Enterprise-Ready Platform**
- [ ] **Enterprise SSO and User Management**: Implement enterprise-grade authentication and user management.
- [ ] **API Ecosystem**: Build a robust, well-documented API for third-party integrations.
- [ ] **Advanced Analytics Dashboard**: Create a dashboard for visualizing system performance, learning progress, and ROI.
- [ ] **White-Label Deployment**: Develop the capability for white-label deployments for our largest partners.

### **Phase 2 Success Metrics**:
- **Learning Rate**: The system's accuracy improves by a measurable 10-15% month-over-month.
- **Domain Coverage**: The platform can handle complex, integrated analysis across Carbon, Nature, and Social domains.
- **Enterprise Adoption**: Secure our first F500 enterprise-level customer.
