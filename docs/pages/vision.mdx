# Project Vision

## Core Idea

Nexus is an AI-native application designed to automate the creation of corporate sustainability reports. It functions as a system of autonomous agents, each specializing in a different aspect of sustainability reporting. These agents collaborate to gather data, perform calculations, and generate reports that are compliant with major carbon accounting standards.

## The Problem

Corporate sustainability reporting is currently a labor-intensive, expensive, and often inaccurate process. Companies spend significant resources on consultants and internal teams to manually gather data and produce reports. This process is prone to errors and inconsistencies, making it difficult to get a true picture of a company's environmental impact.

## The Solution

Nexus aims to solve this problem by providing a fully automated, AI-powered solution. By leveraging a multi-agent system, Nexus can:

- **Automate data collection:** Agents can connect to various data sources (e.g., ERP systems, utility bills, travel logs) to automatically gather the necessary information.
- **Ensure accuracy:** The system can perform complex calculations and data analysis, reducing the risk of human error.
- **Improve efficiency:** By automating the entire process, Nexus can significantly reduce the time and cost associated with sustainability reporting.
- **Provide real-time insights:** The system can provide continuous monitoring and real-time insights into a company's sustainability performance.

## Target Audience

Our primary target audience is medium to large enterprises that are required to or are proactively choosing to report on their sustainability performance. This includes companies in various sectors, such as manufacturing, technology, and finance.

## Long-Term Vision

In the long term, we envision Nexus becoming the go-to platform for all aspects of corporate sustainability management. This includes not only reporting but also performance tracking, goal setting, and strategy development. We aim to create a comprehensive solution that helps companies not only meet their reporting requirements but also drive meaningful improvements in their sustainability performance.
