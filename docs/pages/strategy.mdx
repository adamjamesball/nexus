# Project Strategy

## Go-to-Market

Our go-to-market strategy is to initially focus on a specific niche: mid-market technology companies in North America. This segment is often underserved by existing solutions and is more likely to adopt innovative technologies like Nexus. We will reach this audience through a combination of content marketing, targeted outreach, and partnerships with industry influencers.

## Competitive Advantage

Our key competitive advantages are:

- **AI-native approach:** Unlike traditional software solutions with an AI layer added on, Nexus is built from the ground up as an AI-native system. This allows for a much deeper level of automation and intelligence.
- **Multi-agent system:** Our unique multi-agent architecture allows for a high degree of flexibility and scalability. Each agent is a specialist, and they can be combined in different ways to address a wide range of sustainability reporting requirements.
- **Focus on user experience:** We are committed to creating a simple, intuitive user experience that makes it easy for anyone to use Nexus, regardless of their technical expertise.

## Product Roadmap

Our product roadmap is divided into three phases:

1.  **Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP):** The initial focus is on building a functional MVP that can automate the creation of a basic sustainability report. This includes developing the core agent orchestration system, data collection agents, and a simple reporting interface.
2.  **Phase 2: Expansion:** In the second phase, we will expand the capabilities of Nexus to support a wider range of sustainability reporting standards and data sources. We will also introduce more advanced features, such as benchmarking and goal tracking.
3.  **Phase 3: Platform:** In the final phase, we will transform Nexus into a comprehensive platform for sustainability management. This will include features for supply chain analysis, product lifecycle assessment, and other advanced sustainability topics.
