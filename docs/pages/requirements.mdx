# Technical Requirements

## System Architecture

The system is designed as a modular, multi-agent architecture. The core components are:

- **Frontend:** A Next.js web application that provides the user interface for interacting with the system.
- **Backend:** A Python-based application that orchestrates the autonomous agents and manages the data.
- **Agents:** A collection of specialized AI agents, each responsible for a specific task (e.g., data collection, calculation, report generation).
- **LLM Gateway:** A centralized gateway for interacting with large language models (LLMs) from different providers.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, LangChain
- **Databases:** TBD (likely a combination of vector and relational databases)
- **LLMs:** OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude

## Key Features

The MVP will include the following key features:

- **User authentication:** Users can sign up and log in to the application.
- **Onboarding:** A guided onboarding process to help users set up their organization and connect their data sources.
- **Agent orchestration:** The ability to launch and monitor the autonomous agents.
- **Report generation:** The ability to generate a basic sustainability report in PDF format.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Scalability:** The system must be able to handle a large number of users and organizations.
- **Security:** The system must be secure and protect the confidentiality of user data.
- **Reliability:** The system must be reliable and available 24/7.
