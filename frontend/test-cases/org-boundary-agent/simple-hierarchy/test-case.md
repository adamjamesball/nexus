### Key Insights Expected
- **Boundary Recommendation**: Include all entities for Scope 1 & 2 (100% operational control)
- **Control Assessment**: Operational control identified for all subsidiaries
- **Data Quality**: High quality assessment (minimal issues)

## üîç Validation Criteria

### Primary Success Metrics
- [x] **Entity Count**: Exactly 3 entities identified
- [x] **Relationship Count**: Exactly 2 parent-child relationships
- [x] **Ownership Accuracy**: 100% ownership correctly identified for both relationships
- [x] **Name Matching**: All entity names exactly match expected values
- [x] **Hierarchy Depth**: 3-tier structure correctly mapped

### Secondary Success Metrics
- [x] **Confidence Scores**: Average confidence ‚â•90%
- [x] **Jurisdiction Mapping**: US jurisdictions correctly identified
- [x] **Entity Types**: Appropriate classification (parent, subsidiary, division)
- [x] **Control Assessment**: Operational control correctly identified
- [x] **Processing Time**: Completed within 5 minutes

### Data Quality Assessment
- [x] **No Missing Data Issues**: All required fields populated
- [x] **No Conflicts**: Consistent ownership information across sources
- [x] **No Duplicates**: Each entity identified only once

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Challenges

### Known Issues to Handle
1. **Division vs. Subsidiary**: Solar Division may be classified as either
2. **Legal Entity Types**: LLC vs. Inc. distinctions must be preserved
3. **Site-Entity Mapping**: Multiple sites may belong to same entity

### Expected Agent Behavior
- Should handle minor name variations (e.g., "GreenTech" vs "Green Tech")
- Should correctly aggregate site-level data to entity level
- Should provide high confidence scores for clean, consistent data

## üß™ Testing Process

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Upload `site-list-primary.xlsx` and `org-chart-extract.xlsx`
2. Run Entity Intelligence Agent
3. Review identified entities and relationships
4. Validate against expected outputs
5. Check confidence scores and data quality assessment

### Automated Validation
```bash
npm run test:org-boundary -- --case simple-hierarchy --validate
```
