# Test Case: Joint Ventures & Strategic Partnerships

## üìã Overview

**Test ID**: ORG-003
**Scenario**: Mixed ownership structure with joint ventures and strategic partnerships
**Complexity Level**: Medium-High
**Expected Duration**: 6-8 minutes
**Success Threshold**: 80% accuracy

## üéØ Objectives

Test the Entity Intelligence Agent's ability to:
- Distinguish between subsidiaries, joint ventures, and strategic partnerships
- Handle 50/50 joint venture structures
- Assess operational vs. financial control in partnership scenarios
- Identify equity method investments vs. consolidated entities
- Handle complex governance structures and voting arrangements

## üè¢ Test Scenario

### Corporate Structure
```
CleanEnergy Partners Corp (Parent)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Solar Manufacturing LLC (100% subsidiary)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Wind Development JV (50% joint venture with WindPower Industries)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Grid Storage Solutions LP (60% partnership)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Offshore Wind Ventures (40% strategic investment)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Battery Technology JV (50% joint venture with TechCorp)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Green Hydrogen Partnership (30% minority stake)
```

### Business Context
- **Industry**: Clean Energy Technology & Development
- **Strategy**: Mix of wholly-owned operations and strategic partnerships
- **Geography**: Primarily North America with international JVs
- **Model**: Partnership-driven growth strategy

## üìÑ Input Files

### 1. `partnership-structure.csv`
**Description**: Detailed partnership and ownership structure
**Columns**: Entity Name, Partnership Type, Ownership %, Voting Rights %, Control Type, Partner Names

### 2. `governance-agreements.csv`
**Description**: Governance and control mechanisms
**Columns**: Entity Name, Board Seats, Operational Control, Financial Control, Key Decisions, Veto Rights

## ‚úÖ Expected Outcomes

### Entities to be Identified (7 total)
1. **CleanEnergy Partners Corp** - Parent company (100%)
2. **Solar Manufacturing LLC** - Wholly-owned subsidiary (100%)
3. **Wind Development JV** - Joint venture (50% - shared control)
4. **Grid Storage Solutions LP** - Partnership (60% - majority control)
5. **Offshore Wind Ventures** - Strategic investment (40% - minority stake)
6. **Battery Technology JV** - Joint venture (50% - shared control)
7. **Green Hydrogen Partnership** - Associate company (30% - minority stake)

### Key Control Assessments
- **100% Ownership**: Full operational control (Solar Manufacturing)
- **60% Ownership**: Operational control despite partnership structure (Grid Storage)
- **50% Ownership**: Shared control - requires special assessment (Wind Development, Battery Technology)
- **40% Ownership**: Significant influence but no control (Offshore Wind)
- **30% Ownership**: Equity method investment only (Green Hydrogen)

### Expected Boundary Recommendations
- **Scope 1 & 2**: Include entities with operational control (100% + 60% + potentially 50% JVs)
- **Scope 3**: Include all entities but with appropriate proportional treatment
- **Special Handling**: 50/50 JVs require partner coordination for emissions reporting

## üîç Validation Criteria

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Challenges

### Known Complexities
1. **Shared Control Assessment**: 50/50 JVs require nuanced control evaluation
2. **Governance vs. Ownership**: Voting rights may differ from ownership percentages
3. **Partnership Structures**: LP vs. LLC vs. Corporation distinctions

5. **Sustainability Reporting**: Joint responsibility for 50/50 JVs

### Expected Agent Behavior
- Should flag 50/50 JVs for special review
- Should assess control beyond simple ownership percentage
- Should consider governance mechanisms and board representation
- Should provide sustainability reporting guidance for partnerships
