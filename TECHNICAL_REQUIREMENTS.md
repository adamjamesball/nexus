- **Dynamic Knowledge Graph**: A central, continuously updated graph database that serves as the AI's long-term memory.

### Infrastructure
- **Containerization**: Docker with multi-stage builds for efficient and secure deployments.
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes for scalable and resilient production deployments.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform for managing cloud infrastructure.
- **Monitoring**: A comprehensive OpenTelemetry stack with Prometheus and Grafana.

## Agent Architecture Specifications

### Agent Design Principles
1.  **Single, Deep Responsibility**: Each agent is a world-class expert in its specific domain.
2.  **Stateful and Context-Aware**: Agents maintain a rich, contextual understanding of the task at hand.
3.  **Resilient and Self-Correcting**: Agents can gracefully handle errors and learn from their mistakes.
4.  **Collaborative and Composable**: Agents can be dynamically combined into complex, self-organizing workflows.
5.  **Highly Observable**: Every thought, action, and decision of every agent is logged and auditable.
